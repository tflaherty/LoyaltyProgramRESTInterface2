- change things so we return the number of points with each kind of status (available, held, etc.)
- see if I can write initialization code to initialize database when it's started
- figure out how to handle the action of adding a point transaction and figuring out how to handle point transaction type
    - i.e. do we use standard strings like "add", "delete", etc. or do it through the URL
- implement a Postrgres back end
- figure out how to return a transaction id to the caller
- added a new $scope variable for the mode (list, edit, etc.) for each type!
